Road signs detection sys- tem Introduction1) The dynamic road sign display system records standard traffic signs by means of a camera located in the upper central area of the wind- screen, housed in the compartment at the base of the interior mirror, and reports any speed restrictions, overtaking prohibitions and warning signs that it recognises. Within its limitations, the system also displays a additional sign to indicate aspects such as temporary prohibitions. Even on routes with- out signs, the system can, if necessary, display the applicable speed limits. Road sign recognition does not work in all countries. Keep this in mind when travelling abroad. The additional signs are displayed on the Head-up-Display and on the instrument clus- ter as generic additional signs. Shown on the display Fig. 7  On the instrument cluster display: example of speed limits with a generic additional sign. In Germany, on motorways and normal roads for vehicles, besides speed limits and overtak- ing provisions the system also displays end of restriction signs. In all other countries the cur- rently valid speed limit is displayed instead. The road signs detected by the system are displayed on the instrument cluster display ››› Fig. 7 and, depending on the navigation system fitted in the vehicle, in the infotainment system as well . Depending on the equipment, an indication is also displayed on the Head-up-Display. Display of road signs After checking and evaluating the information from the camera, the infotainment system and actual vehicle data, the system displays up to two current road signs, and a generic addi- tional sign ››› Fig. 7: ●First: The sign that is currently valid for the driver is displayed on the left hand side of the screen, e.g. a prohibition of driving at over 130 km/h (80 mph). ●Second: Another road sign, such as a warn- ing sign, can be displayed in second place. ●Additional sign: If an additional sign is de- tected, e.g. for temporary limits, it is shown be- low the valid road sign. For system reasons, a generic sign is displayed instead of the actual detected sign. The valid road sign is displayed on the Head- up-Display by the generic additional sign. The warning sign display is not available in all countries and the system may not be able to detect all existing warning signs. No entry sign The road sign recognition system gives a warn- ing on the instrument cluster when a no entry sign is passed on a one-way road or an en- trance to a motorway or highway.",

When the ignition is switched on, the seat belt status display ››› Fig. 17 informs the driver on the instrument cluster display whether the oc- cupants have their seat belts fastened. Depending on seat occupancy and the status of the seat belts, the vehicle's seats will light up in different colours: A grey light indicates that the correspond- ing seat is not occupied. A green light indicates that the seat is oc- cupied and the occupant is wearing the seat belt. A red light indicates that the seat is occu- pied and the occupant is not wearing the seat belt. If a speed of 25 km/h (15 mph) is exceeded after moving off without the driver or a front passenger seatbelt being fastened, or if the seatbelt is unfastened while driving, an audible signal will sound for 126 seconds.

Head-on collisions and the laws of physics Fig. 18  A driver not wearing a seat belt may be thrown forward violently. Fig. 19  Any rear seat occupants not wearing a seat belt may be thrown forward violently, hitting the driver who is wearing the seat belt. The effects of the laws of physics in the case of a head-on collision are easy to explain: the moment a vehicle starts moving, a type of en- ergy called “kinetic energy” starts acting on both the vehicle and its passengers. The amount of “kinetic energy” depends on the speed of the vehicle and on the weight of the vehicle and of its passengers. The taller they are, the more energy there is to be “ab- sorbed” in the event of an accident. The most significant factor, however, is the speed of the vehicle. If the speed doubles from 25 km/h (15 mph) to 50 km/h (30 mph), for example, the corresponding kinetic energy is multiplied by four.",

PreCrash system How it works The PreCrash system is an assistance system that actives a series of measures to protect the occupants of the vehicles in potentially risky situations, but which cannot prevent a collision. It only works completely if no special driving profile is selected and if there are no operating anomalies. At the start of each journey and depending on the time of use and the speed of the vehicle, the seatbelt is automatically pretensioned in order to reduce slack in the driver's and front passenger's seatbelts, provided they are buck- led. Basic features Depending on the legal provisions of the coun- try and the features of the vehicle, in critical situations (e.g. in certain cases of emergency braking or loss of control of the vehicle by the driver) the following functions can be activated separately or at the same time when the vehi- cle is travelling faster than approximately 30 km/h (20 mph). ●Reversible tensioning of front seat belts that are fastened. ●Operation of the hazard warning lights. ●Automatic closing of the windows until there is only a crack left. Depending on how critical the driving situation is, the belts are either tightened individually, or both belts at the same time. In addition to Front Assist In vehicles with Front Assist ››› page 188, within the limits of the system, information is assessed on the risk of collision with the ve- hicle in front. The functions of the PreCrash system may also be activated if there is a high likelihood of a rear-end collision, or during the activation of Front Assist. In addition to Side Assist In vehicles with Side Assist,››› page 200, within the limitations of this system, informa- tion is assessed on the risk of collision with traffic to the rear of the vehicle. If a rear-end collision is highly likely, the functions of the PreCrash system may also be activated. In this situation, the hazard warning lights are turned on with a higher frequency of flashes.",

Otherwise there is a danger that during a collision, the system may fail to trigger, or not trigger correctly. Airbag activation The airbags deploy extremely rapidly, within thousandths of a second, to provide additional protection in the event of an accident. A fine dust may develop when the airbag deploys. This is normal and it is not an indication of fire in the vehicle. The airbag system is only ready to function when the ignition is on. In special accidents instances, several airbags may activate at the same time. Airbags do not activate in the event of minor head-on and side collisions or rear-end colli- sions. Activation factors The conditions that lead to the airbag system activating in each situation cannot be general- ised. Some factors play an important role, such as the properties of the object the vehicle hits (hard/soft), angle of impact, vehicle speed, etc. Deceleration trajectory is key for airbag activa- tion. The control unit analyses the collision trajec- tory and activates the respective restraint sys- tem. If the deceleration rate is below the predefined reference value in the control unit the airbags will not be triggered, even though the accident may cause extensive damage to the car. The following airbags are triggered in serious head-on collisions: ●Driver airbag. ●Front passenger front airbag ●Head airbags. In the event of serious side collisions, some (or all) of the following airbags can be acti- vated (depending on the severity of the col- lision): ●Head airbags. ●Front side airbag on the side of the accident. ● Central airbag.

CUPRA recommends fitting the child seat in the rear seat to avoid having to deactivate the front passenger airbag. When the front passenger airbag is deactiva- ted, this means that only the front passenger front airbag is deactivated. All the other airbags in the vehicle remain activated. Deactivate and activate the front passenger front airbag ●Disconnect the drive system. ●Open the passenger side door. ●Remove the key shaft from the vehicle key. ●Insert the key blade into the slot provided in the front passenger airbag disconnection switch ››› Fig. 27. About 3/4 of the key should enter; this is as far as it will go. ●Turn the key gently to change its position to (deactivate) or to (activate). If you have difficulty, ensure that you have inserted the key as far as it will go. ●Close the front passenger door. ●When deactivating the airbag, switch the ig- nition on and check that the control lamp remains lit ››› Fig. 28.",

Do not leave any heavy or sharp-edged objects in the pockets. Please, do not hang the clothes on coat hangers. ●The airbags provide protection for just one accident; replace them once they have de- ployed. ●Any work on the head-protection airbag system or removal and installation of the air- bag components for other repairs (such as removal of the roof lining) should only be performed by a specialised workshop. Other- wise, faults may occur during the airbag sys- tem operation. ●The side and head airbags are managed through sensors located in the interior of the front doors. To ensure the correct operation of the side and curtain airbags neither the doors nor the door panels should be modi- fied in any way (e.g. fitting loudspeakers). If the front door is damaged, the airbag system may not work correctly. All work carried out on the front door must be done in a special- ised workshop. Transporting children safely Introduction For safety reasons, as we have learned from accident statistics, we recommend that chil- dren under 12 years of age travel in the rear seats. Depending on their age, height and weight, children travelling in rear seats must use a child seat or a seat belt. For safety rea- sons, the child seat should be installed in the rear seat, behind the front passenger seat or in the centre back seat. The laws of physics involved and the forces acting in a collision apply also to children ››› page 42. But unlike adults, children do not have fully developed muscle and bone struc- tures. This means that children are subject to a greater risk of injury. To reduce the risk of injuries, children must always use special child restraint systems when travelling in the vehicle. We recommend the use of child safety products from the Genuine Accessories Pro- gramme, which includes systems for all ages (see www.cupraaccessories.com). These systems have been especially de- signed and approved and comply with the UN ECE R129 (i-Size) regulation. CUPRA recommends securing the child seats shown on the website as described below: ●Rear-facing child seat (group 0+): ISOFIX and support leg (Britax Römer Baby-Safe 3 i-SIZE + Flex Base i-SENSE). ●Forward-facing child seat (group 1): ISOFIX AND Top Tether (Britax Römer TRIFIX 2 i-Size). ●Forward-facing child seat (group 2): seat belt and ISOFIX (Britax Römer KIDFIX i-Size). You must also use the seat’s “Secure-Guard” seat- belt connection point and adjust the side im- pact protection system “SICT” (available on certain models), located in the seat backrest. Adjust only the “SICT” closest to the door. Please follow the child seat manufacturer's us- age instructions. ●Forward-facing child seat (group 3): seat belt and ISOFIX (Britax Römer KIDFIX i-Size). Group 3 can use the seat with backrest or only the seat base without the backrest (booster). The backrest of the child seat has an adult seat belt guide and a head restraint, meaning that the seat with the backrest offers better protection than boosters without backrests. CUPRA rec- ommends the use of child seats with backrests. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and ob- serve any statutory requirements when instal- ling and using child seats. Always read and note ››› page 58.",

There is no need to consult any list of models. In the case of universal approval for ISOFIX, the child seat is additionally provided with a Top Tether belt. ●Semi-universal: semi-universal approval, in addition to the standard requirements of uni- versal approval, requires safety devices to lock the child seat, which require additional test- ing. Child seats with semi-universal approval include a list of vehicle models for which they can be installed. ●Vehicle-specific: vehicle-specific approval requires a dynamic test of the child seat for each vehicle model separately. Child seats with vehicle-specific approval also include a list of vehicle models for which they can be installed. ●i-Size: child seats with i-Size approval must meet the requirements prescribed in the ECE- R 129 standard in relation to installation and safety.

Warnings about fitting a child seat Take the following general warnings into ac- count if you are going to fit a child seat. They are valid for all child seats regardless of their attachment system. ●Please read and follow the child seat manu- facturer's operating instructions. ●The child seat should preferably be fitted to the rear seat behind the front passenger seat so that the child can exit the vehicle on the pavement side. ●Set the height of the seat belt such that it adapts to the child seat naturally, without twisting. The lowest position of the seat belt height regulator must be used with rear-facing child seats. ●To correctly use a child seat in the back, the front backrest must be adjusted so that there is no contact with the child seat in the back if it is rear facing. In the case of front facing restraint systems, the front backrest must be adjusted so that there is no contact with the child's feet. ●For a correct assembly of the child's seat on the rear seats, adjust or dismount the head- rest, in order to prevent contact with the seat. ●If a semi-universal type seat is to be installed, in which the method of attachment to the car is through the seat belt and support bracket, it should never be installed in the central rear seat as the ground clearance is lower than in other places and the support bracket will not allow the seat to remain sufficiently stable. Important information about the front pas- senger airbag A sticker with important information about the passenger airbag is located on the passenger's sunshade blind and/or on the passenger side door frame ››› Fig. 35. Read and always observe the safety informa- tion included in the following chapters: ●Safety distance with respect to the passenger airbag ››› page 48. ●Objects between the passenger and the pas- senger side airbag ››› in Front airbags on page 52. The passenger side front airbag, when ena- bled, is a serious risk for a rear-facing child since the airbag can strike the seat with such force that it can cause serious or fatal injuries. Children up to 12 years old should always travel on the rear seat. Therefore we strongly recommend that you transport children on the rear seats. This is the safest location in the vehicle. Alternatively, the front passenger airbag can be disabled with a key-operated switch ››› page 52. When trans- porting children, use a child seat suitable for the age and size of each child ››› page 57.",

Do not forget to reconnect the airbag when an adult wants to sit in the front passenger seat. ●Never allow a child to be transported in a vehicle without being properly secured, or to stand up or kneel on a seat while travel- ling. In an accident, the child could be flung through the vehicle, causing possibly fatal in- juries to themselves and to the other vehicle occupants. ●Never leave a child alone in the child seat or in the vehicle. ●Children who are less than 1.50 m tall must not wear a normal seat belt without a child seat, as this could cause injuries to the ab- dominal and neck areas during a sudden braking manoeuvre or in an accident. ●When a child seat is mounted in the rear seats, the door's child lock should be activa- ted. Attachment systems Depending on the country, different attach- ment systems are used for safely installing child seats. Attachment systems overview ●ISOFIX: ISOFIX is a standardised attachment system allowing quick and safe attachment of child seats in the vehicle. ISOFIX attachment establishes a rigid connection between the child seat and the car body. The child seat has two rigid attachment clips, called connectors. These connectors are fit- ted into the ISOFIX attachment rings found between the seat cushion and the backrest of the vehicle's back seat (on the sides). ISO- FIX attachment systems are used mainly in Eu- rope ››› page 60. If necessary, ISOFIX at- tachment may have to be supplemented with a Top Tether belt or a support bracket. ●Automatic three-point seat belt. Whenever possible, it is preferable to attach the child seats with the ISOFIX system rather than at- taching them with an automatic three-point seat belt ››› page 64. Additional attachment: ●Top Tether: the Top Tether belt is guided over the back of the rear seat and attached to an anchor point with a hook. Anchor points are located at the back of the rear seat backrest on the luggage compartment side ››› page 63. The rings for retaining the Top Tether belt are marked with an anchor symbol. ●Support bracket: some child seats rest on the floor of the vehicle with a support bracket. The support bracket prevents the child seat from tipping forward in the event of impact. Child seats fitted with a support bracket should only be used in the passenger seat and side rear seats ›››",

The control element is located on the roof console ››› Fig. 47. With the emergency call, help can be organ- ised as quickly as possible in emergency situa- tions. A voice connection is established with a public rescue coordination centre. The tele- phone contact person communicates in the language of the country in which the vehicle is located. In addition, any legally required data relevant to emergency calls is automatically transmitted to the public rescue control cen- tre, such as the vehicle's current location. The required connection is made via a factory- installed control unit. Additional components such as an emergency call microphone, an emergency loudspeaker and an integrated bat- tery which is independent of the integrated power supply, are required to ensure operation even after a serious accident. Activating an emergency call manually 1. Briefly press the button cover and open the cover ››› Fig. 47. 2. Press and hold the emergency call button for a few seconds ››› Fig. 48 1 .",

It is intended to remind you to turn off the turn signals, unless you want to leave the parking light on. ●If the convenience turn signals are on (three flashes) and the convenience turn sig- nal on the opposite side is activated, the ac- tive side stops flashing and only flashes once on the newly selected side. ●The turn signal only works when the igni- tion is switched on. The turn signals only work when the ignition is switched on. ●The main beam can only be switched on when the dipped beam is switched on. ●If a trailer turn signal fails, the indicator light (trailer turn signals) stops flashing, in- stead of flashing the turn signal at double speed in the vehicle. ●In cold or wet weather conditions, the headlights, tail lights and turn signals may be temporarily fogged from the inside. This is normal and has no effect on the service life of the vehicle's lighting system. ●The parking light does not activate auto- matically if the left- or right-hand turn signal is left on and the ignition is disconnected. Main beam assist (Light Assist) The main beam assist automatically prevents glare from vehicles moving in the opposite di- rection or ahead in the same direction. In addi- tion, the main beam assist detects illuminated areas and disconnects the main beam head- light when passing, e.g. by populated areas. Within its limitations, the assist system auto- matically connects or disconnects the main beam headlight depending on the environ- mental and traffic conditions, as well as the speed ››› . Advanced main beam assistant (LED Matrix) The advanced main beam assistant provides maximum illumination of the road and road- side. At the same time, it avoids dazzling vehi- cles ahead or oncoming traffic. The system uses a camera to detect other road users and deactivates certain areas within the light distribution in a specific manner. If the system cannot avoid dazzling other road users, the main beam is switched off completely. The advanced main beam assistant normally recognizes illuminated areas such as cities and deactivates the main beam while driving through them. Within the limits of the system, the assistant automatically switches the main beam on or off depending on the ambient conditions, traf- fic conditions and driving speed. The advanced main beam assistant can be switched on or off in the vehicle settings in the Infotainment System. Switching on the main beam assist or advanced main beam assist (Matrix LED) ●Switch on the ignition and select mode on the headlight control ››› Fig. 93. ●From the neutral position, press the turn sig- nal and main beam headlights lever forwards ››› Fig. 94 3 . When the main beam assist is switched on, the control lamp on the instrument cluster screen turns on. When the main beam is on, the blue main beam control lamp on the instrument cluster switches on.",

Driving abroad The light beam of the dipped beam lights is asymmetric: the side of the road on which you are driving is lit more intensely. When a car that is manufactured in a country that drives on the right travels to a country that drives on the left (or vice versa), it is normally necessary to cover part of the headlight bulbs with stickers or to change the adjustment of the headlights to avoid dazzling other drivers. In such cases, the regulations specify certain light values that must be complied with for designated points of the light distribution. This is known as “Tourist light”. The light distribution of the headlights allows the specific “tourist light” values to be met without the need for stickers or changes being made to the settings.",

Some of the systems that can be adapted are the suspension, steering, drive system and air con- ditioning. Depending on the vehicle’s equipment, vari- ous drive profiles can be selected. The degree of influence of the vehicle's systems on the dif- ferent drive profiles depends on the vehicle’s equipment. Vehicles with adaptive suspension (DCC) When driving, the adaptive suspension (DCC) continuously adapts the suspension to the terrain and the driving situation in question. When doing so, the DCC also takes into ac- count the vehicle's configuration in the selec- ted drive profile. Engine sound It adds excitement to driving by improving on the sound of the electric motor through the Infotainment System, depending on the selec- ted drive profile. This sound is based on the CUPRA “Adrenaline” concept. Its volume is in proportion to the pressure exerted on the ac- celerator pedal and the RPM of the electric motor. The configuration is preset for each profile and can be modified in the Individual profile.

If the vehicle is frequently used in city traffic and for short distances, or for sporty driving, brake pad thickness should be checked regularly at a specialist workshop. Driving with wet brakes, e.g. after driving through water, in heavy rain or after washing the vehicle, braking performance may be af- fected by wet brake discs, or even frozen discs in winter. The driver should be ready to brake harder. If the brake discs and pads have a layer of salt on them, the braking performance is reduced and the braking distance increases.

Brake assist systems Information relating to brake assist systems Brake assist systems can help the driver in crit- ical driving or braking situations. The driver is responsible for driving safely ››› . When the brake assist systems are regulating the brakes, the brake pedal may move or make noises. Even so, continue to brake with the necessary force and control the trajectory of the vehicle if necessary. Depending on the equipment, the ESC and TCS settings can be changed in the vehicle. ●The ESC, ABS and TCS can only operate cor- rectly if the four wheels are fitted with the stipulated tyres ››› . ●If a fault occurs in the ABS, the ESC, TCS and EDS also cease to function. Electronic Stability Control (ESC) The ESC helps to reduce the risk of skidding and to improve stability in certain driving situa- tions ››› . Traction control (TCS) The TCS reduces the driving force on skidding wheels and adapts this force to suit the road surface conditions. The TCS facilitates starting, acceleration and hill climbing ››› . Electronic brake pressure distribution (EBV) Electronic brake force distribution (EBV) regu- lates the braking force between the front and rear axles. Excessive braking of the rear axle is avoided and the vehicle remains stable during the braking operation. Anti-lock braking system (ABS), The ABS can prevent the wheels from locking up under braking until shortly before the vehi- cle comes to a stop, and helps the driver main- tain control of the steering and the vehicle ››› . Brake assist (BAS) Brake assist (BAS) can help to reduce the brak- ing distance. Brake Assist increases the pres- sure exerted by the driver when the brake pedal is depressed quickly in an emergency. Electronic differential lock (EDS and XDS) The EDS automatically brakes skidding wheels and transmits the driving force to the other driving wheels. XDS improves traction by applying the brakes to improve cornering acceleration.",

Pedestrian and cyclist recognition The system recognises pedestrians and cyclists who travel in the same lane and direction and pedestrians and cyclists who transversely cross the vehicle's path. Pedestrian and cyclist recognition technology cannot exceed the physically prescribed limits and works exclusively within the system’s limits. The responsibility for braking always depends on the driver. The pedestrian and cyclist recognition can cause undesired warnings and braking inter- ventions, e.g. with a hidden radar sensor or a dirty camera field of vision. Be ready to take charge of the vehicle at any time. The pedestrian and cyclist recognition operat- ing speed range is lower than that of Front As- sist. Dodge assist Dodge assist helps the driver avoid an obstacle in critical conditions. Once the Front Assist has activated a critical warning, if the driver intends to dodge the ob- ject, the swerve assist will help correct the tra- jectory. The driver must start and finish the manoeuvre, as this is an assistance system and not an autonomous one. The system is active between approximately 30 km/h (20 mph) and 150 km/h (90 mph).

Lane Assist system Introduction The Lane Assist System helps the driver stay in his/her lane within the physical limits of the system. This function is not suitable and is not designed to keep the vehicle automatically in the lane. Using the camera located in the windscreen, the Lane Assist system detects the lane boun- daries dividing the lanes in which the vehi- cle is travelling. If the vehicle gets too close to the detected lane limits, the system alerts the driver through a corrective motion of the steering wheel. The driver can cancel the steering corrective action at any time. No warning will be given when the turn signals are activated, given that the Lane Assist system understands that a lane change is required. System limits Use the Lane Assist system only on large, well- maintained motorways and highways. The system is not available under the following conditions: ●The driving speed allowed is below approx. 60 km/h (35 mph). ●The system has not detected any lane lines. ●On tight bends. ●Temporarily in very sporty driving situations. ●If the driver firmly rectifies a system interven- tion. ●If a lane marking is crossed despite system intervention. ●If the driver does not react to a request to intervene.",

Lane departure warning (Side Assist) Introduction The lane departure warning uses radar sen- sors to monitor the areas behind the vehicle ››› page 6. The system does this by measuring the vehicle's distance from other vehicles and its speed differential. The lane departure warn- ing will not work at speeds of less than approx. 15 km/h (9 mph). Lane width is not detected individually, but is rather pre-configured in the system. Thus if you are driving in wide lanes or in between two lanes, the indications may be incorrect. Furthermore, the system can detect vehicles driving in the lane next to you (if there are any), and can also detect stationary objects such as dividers, and thus give an incorrect indication. Trailer mode Side assist is automatically deactivated and cannot be switched on if the factory-fitted tow-bar is electrically connected to a trailer or similar device. As soon as the driver starts to drive with a trailer connected electrically to the vehicle, a message is displayed on the instrument cluster display indicating that side assist is switched off. Once the vehicle trailer has been disen- gaged, side assist will return to the initial state prior to the moment the trailer was electrically connected. If the tow-bar is not factory fitted, side assist should be switched off manually when driving with a trailer. Physical limitations inherent to the system In some situations the lane departure warning may not interpret the traffic situation correctly. I.e. in the following situations: ●on tight bends; ●in the case of lanes with different widths; ●in areas with significant gradient changes; ●in adverse weather conditions; ●in the case of special constructions to the side of the vehicle, e.g., high or irregular divid- ers.",

Conditions necessary for the use of the Area View system ●The doors and the rear lid must be closed. ●The image must be reliable and clear. For this reason, for example, the camera lens must be clean. ●The area around the vehicle must be clearly and totally visible. ●The area for parking or manoeuvring should be a flat surface. ●The vehicle should not be loaded very heav- ily at the rear. ● The driver must be used to the system. ●There should be no damage to the vehicle in the camera area. If the position or installation angle of the cameras have been changed, e.g. after a rear-end collision, the system should be checked by a specialised workshop. Special characteristics The images on the area view system cameras are only two-dimensional. Due to a lack of spa- tial depth, it is difficult or impossible to make out on-screen any holes there may be on the ground, objects jutting out from the ground or parts protruding from other vehicles. Situations in which the objects or other vehi- cles appear to be further away or closer than they really are: ● On moving from a horizontal plane to a slope. ●On moving from a slope to a horizontal plane. ●If the vehicle is heavily loaded at the rear. ●If the vehicle approaches protruding objects. These objects may be outside the cameras' angle of visibility.

Car2X communication Introduction How Car2X works1) Car2X enables communication between sev- eral vehicles, as well as between vehicles and the road infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as “participants”) in the vicinity. Communica- tion between the participants is established in accordance with Car2X and WLAN (Wi- Fi) standards, regardless of the manufacturer. Car2X only works in some countries. When Car2X is connected, data are transmit- ted permanently between the participants, re- gardless of whether their vehicles are in online or offline mode. To prevent misuse and to sign Car2X data with changing IDs, Car2X data transmitters must have valid certificates. This means that each of the recipients can check that the Car2X data are authentic and that they come from a legiti- mate participant. The vehicle’s own certificates can only be re- newed automatically in online mode. To update the Car2X certificates to ensure that Car2X remains active, activate the Online mode in the vehicle at least once a month. Continuously changing provisional Car2X data IDs minimises the probability that the data that is sent can be linked to you personally. Meaning of the symbol Indicates that the connected Car2X also sends and receives data in Offline mode. Data transmissions When Car2X is connected, the following data are sent and received via the Car2X antennas: ●Vehicle data such as speed. ●Position data. ●Data about incidents, e.g. accidents. Car2X distinguishing element If you can switch on Car2X communication in Privacy settings in the infotainment system, this means that the vehicle is fitted with Car2X technology. Note Further information on data processing can be found in the Legal notice menu in the infotainment system and on the CUPRA web- site.",

Such data can also pro- vide (at least indirectly) information about the driver in question, for example, driving behav- iour and location. As a contracting party in the CUPRA CONNECT contract with SEAT, S.A., you must ensure that when your vehicle is used by other drivers (for example, family or friends), data protection and personal rights are respected. Therefore, you must inform drivers in advance that the vehicle transfers and receives data online, and that you can ac- cess such data. Failure to take this obligation to inform into ac- count can infringe certain rights of the occu- pants. Personal information CUPRA protects your personal data and only uses them as permitted by law, or if you have given your consent to a certain use. Detailed information on data processing in connection with the CUPRA CONNECT services can be found in the Data Protection Declaration, the current version of which can be accessed on the CUPRA website. Permanent transfer of the vehicle If the vehicle has been purchased used or someone else has left the vehicle to you for permanent use, CUPRA CONNECT may al- ready be activated and the previous primary user may still be able to access the data regis- tered via CUPRA CONNECT and control certain functions of your vehicle. You can automatically remove the previous pri- mary user by registering yourself as the primary user of the vehicle. Alternatively, you can re- store the infotainment system to factory set- tings ( > Restore factory settings) or set the vehicle to offline mode (››› page 247) and therefore limit both your vehicle's communica- tion with the CUPRA data service and the pro- cessing of personal and vehicle data. Deactivating CUPRA CONNECT services The following functions are available to ac- tivate and deactivate the CUPRA CONNECT services: ● Allow or prevent data transmissions through the infotainment system ››› page 247, Pri- vacy mode. ●Wherever possible: individual deactivation or activation through your user account in the My CUPRA App. You can run the relevant services again after cancelling their deactivation.

Only the image of the rear view camera system can be displayed during system start-up. ●The display of all indications and the execu- tion of functions only takes place once the in- fotainment system has finished booting. The duration of the system booting depends on the number of infotainment functions and may take longer than normal in the event of very high or very low temperatures. ●When using the infotainment system and corresponding accessories, e.g., headphones, bear in mind country-specific regulations and legal provisions. ●The online navigation, online voice com- mand and Internet Radio functions (among others) require the activation of CUPRA CON- NECT Gen4 services (linked to the CUPRA CONNECT PLUS pack) and an Internet con- nection for the vehicle. The data transmission must not be limited to perform the functions. ●To use the infotainment system, simply lightly press a button or touch the screen. ●For the correct operation of the infotain- ment system it is important that it is switched on and that, if necessary, the time and date of the vehicle are set correctly. ●If a function button is missing on the screen, it is not a device defect, but corresponds to the specific equipment of the country or version. ●Some infotainment functions can only be se- lected when the vehicle is at a standstill. In some countries, the gear selector must also be in parking position P or neutral N. This is not a malfunction, but is due to compliance with legal requirements. ●Restrictions on the use of devices using Bluetooth® technology may apply in some countries. For further information, contact the local authorities. ●If you disconnect the 12-volt battery, turn on the ignition before restarting the infotainment system. ●If the setup is changed, this may change the display on the screen and in some cases, the infotainment system may behave in a manner different to that described in this instruction manual. ●When the drive system is switched off and the charge level of the vehicle’s 12 V battery is low, the infotainment system switches off auto- matically. ●Ensure that any repairs or modifications that need to be carried out on the infotainment system are carried out by a specialised work- shop. To do so, CUPRA recommends going to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealer- ship. ●Using a mobile phone device inside the vehi- cle may cause noise in the speakers. ●On vehicles with park assist, the audio source volume is automatically lowered when reverse gear is selected. The volume reduction can be adjusted. ●Information about the included software and the license conditions can be found in Set- tings > Information > Copyright. ●When selling or lending the vehicle, make sure that all saved data, files and settings have been deleted and, if necessary, external audio sources and data media have been removed.

CUPRA Assistant Introduction Note The CUPRA Assistant function is not available in all markets. The CUPRA Assistant works both online1) and offline, taking into account the aspects indica- ted in the section “Languages available de- pending on the market”. In offline mode the catalogue of voice controls is limited. For a better user experience, it is advisable to use the online mode by activat- ing the online voice assistant via the My CU- PRA App, which provides the user with a wider range of voice controls. The CUPRA Assistant understands questions and expressions without having to learn com- mands. Commands can be freely formulated and can be colloquial. For better system oper- ation, it is recommended to always include a verb in the voice control. Command proposals can be found in the infotainment system, for example in the MENU > CUPRA Assistant > Tips menu. Loud noises inside or outside the vehicle can cause malfunctions, as well as confusing phra- ses and answers. Seat-dependent speech recognition Thanks to additional microphones, the CUPRA Assistant can recognise whether the person speaking is the driver or the passenger. There- fore, in the case of the available languages, you can access functions for a specific seat, such as switching on the seat heating. Languages available depending on the mar- ket ●Online and offline: German, American Eng- lish, British English, French, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. These languages have advanced functions such as Online Com- mands, air conditioning control, natural inter- action, etc. ●Offline: Finnish, Mexican Spanish.",

Trailer mode Introduction Take into account country-specific regulations about driving with a trailer and the use of a towing bracket. The vehicle has been developed primarily for carrying people, although it can also be used to tow a trailer if fitted with the corresponding technical equipment. This additional load has an effect on the useful life, fuel consumption and vehicle performance and in some cases can reduce the service intervals. Driving with a trailer requires more force from the vehicle, and thus more concentration from the driver. In winter, winter tyres should be fitted on both the vehicle and the trailer. Maximum vertical load technically permitted on the coupling device The maximum vertical load technically permit- ted from the trailer draw bar on the towing bracket's tow ball is 80 kg. Vehicles with driving profile selection If you are going to be towing a trailer, the use of the Eco driving profile is not recommended. You are advised to select another of the avail- able driving profiles before beginning to drive with a trailer.",

This also applies in countries where driving at higher speeds is permitted. Take into account the speed limit for vehicles with trailers in the corresponding country, as it could be less than the speed limit for vehi- cles without a trailer. ●Never attempt to “straighten” the towing vehicle and trailer while accelerating. Note ● Before hitching or unhitching a trailer, always deactivate the anti-theft alarm ››› page 101. Otherwise, the tilt sensor could cause the alarm to go off. ●CUPRA recommends that, if possible, the tow hook be removed or covered when it is not going to be used. In the event of a rear-end collision, the damage to the vehicle could be greater if the tow hook is fitted. ●Some retrofitted towing brackets cover the rear towing eye. In these cases, the towing eye should not be used for tow-starting or for towing other vehicles.

With the engine running, elec- trical devices on the trailer receive power from the electrical connection (pin 9 and pin 10 of the trailer power socket). If the system detects that a trailer has been connected, the consumers on the trailer will receive electricity through this connection (pins 9 and 10). Pin 9 has a permanent live. This powers, for example, the trailer's interior lighting. Electrical devices such as a fridge in a caravan only receive electrical power if the engine is running (through pin 10). To avoid overloading the electrical system, you cannot connect the ground wires of pin 3, pin 11 or pin 13. If the trailer has a 7-contact connector, you will need to use an adapter cable. In this case the function corresponding to pin 10 will not be available.

How- ever, make sure that the cable does not rub on the ground while driving.

Specific features of driving with a trailer ● If your trailer has an overrun brake, brake gently at first and then rapidly. This will prevent the jerking that can be caused by the locking of trailer wheels. ●Due to the gross combination weight of the towing vehicle and trailer, the braking distance increases. ●The trailer weight, as well as the gross combi- nation weight of the towing vehicle and trailer, change the centre of gravity and the proper- ties of the vehicle. ●If the towing vehicle is empty and the trailer is loaded, then the load distribution is incor- rect. Under these conditions, drive slowly and with extra caution. Hill starts with a trailer Depending on the slope of the hill and the combination weight of the towing vehicle and trailer, the vehicle might start rolling backwards slightly when you first start up.

Both drivers should be well informed of the special features of towing. Inexperienced drivers should refrain from tow- ing. During towing, make sure at all times that no inadmissible pulling forces or jolts are caused. On roads without a firm surface there is always the danger of overloading the attachment parts. Observe the legal provisions regarding towing. Towing Towing means a vehicle pulling another vehicle that is not in a condition to drive. The vehicle can be towed with a tow bar or cable. ●The speed limit is 50 km/h (30 mph). ●The maximum permitted distance is 50 km (30 miles). Tow cable and tow bar It is safer for the vehicle to be towed using a tow bar, avoiding damage to the vehicle. The tow cable should only be used if a tow bar is not available. A tow rope should be slightly elastic to avoid damage to both vehicles. It is advisable to use a tow rope made of synthetic fibre or similarly elastic material. Towing with a tow truck The vehicle may only be transported on a tow truck if all four wheels are supported.

If an unsuitable tow bar is used, both the tow hitch and the vehicle may be damaged. Instead, a tow rope should be used. Fuses Introduction In general, a fuse can be assigned to various electrical components. Likewise, an electrical component can be protected by several fuses. Only replace fuses when the cause of the problem has been solved. If a newly inserted fuse blows after a short time, you must have the electrical system checked by a specialised workshop as soon as possible. Fuses for the emergency services (high volt- age system) In the fuse box inside the vehicle ››› page 314 there is a high voltage system fuse marked with a little yellow flag that allows the emer- gency services to cut off the vehicle's voltage as quickly as possible. Never replace this fuse yourself or place it where other fuses are lo- cated. If this fuse fails, have it replaced by a qualified specialist workshop. Rescue cut-off point (high voltage system) Under the right rear tail light there is a loop also identified with a yellow flag which, if nec- essary, can be cut by the emergency services. Warning! To access this loop, remove the tail light’s lower rubber waterproof seal, or remove the tail light or, in extreme cases, break it.",

    "content": "Wheels and tyres Wheels and tyres Important information about wheels and tyres General notes ●Your vehicle is fitted with “self-sealing”tyres. This system seals punctures smaller than 5 mm so that the tyre does not have to be replaced. If the puncture ››› page 342 is not sealed, you should call for help or wait for roadside assistance services. ● When driving with new tyres, be especially careful during the first 600 km (300 miles). ●If you have to drive over a kerb or similar ob- stacle, drive very slowly and as near as possible at a right angle to the obstacle. ●Check from time to time if the tyres are damaged (punctures, cuts, cracks or dents). Remove any foreign objects embedded in the treads. ●Damaged wheels and tyres must be replaced immediately. ●Keep grease, oil and fuel off the tyres. ●Replace any missing valve caps as soon as possible. ●Mark the wheels before taking them off so that they rotate in the same direction when put back. ●When removed, the wheels or tyres should be stored in a cool, dry and preferably dark place. Low profile tyres Low profile tyres have a wider tread, a larger wheel diameter and a lower sidewall height. This results in more agile driving behaviour. Low profile tyres may deteriorate more quickly than standard tyres, for instance due to heavy impacts, potholes, manhole covers and kerbs. Correct tyre pressure is very important ››› page 334. To avoid damage to tyres and wheels, drive with special care when driving on roads in poor condition. Visually check your wheels every 3000 km. If the tyres or rims have received a heavy im- pact or have been damaged, have a special- ised workshop check whether or not it is nec- essary to change the tyre. Low profile tyres may deteriorate more quickly than standard tyres. Concealed damage Damage to tyres and rims is often not readily visible. If you notice unusual vibration or the car pulling to one side, this may indicate that one of the tyres is damaged. Reduce speed im- mediately if there is any reason to suspect that damage may have occurred. Inspect the tyres for damage. If no external damage is visible, drive slowly and carefully to the nearest speci- alised workshop and have the car inspected. Foreign objects inserted in the tyre ●Do not remove foreign bodies if they have penetrated through the tyre wall! ●Use a specialised workshop for repair or re- placement. CUPRA recommends going to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealer- ship for this purpose. The sealant inside the tyre tread wraps around the foreign body and provisionally seals the tyre. Tyres with directional tread pattern An arrow on the tyre sidewall indicates the rotation direction on directional tyres. Always note the rotation direction indicated when mounting the wheel. This makes sure that op- timal use is made of tyre properties in terms of aquaplaning, grip, excessive noise and wear. Retrofitting of accessories If you wish to change or fit wheels, rims or wheel trims, we recommend that you consult with a specialised CUPRA Service or SEAT Offi- cial Service centre for advice regarding current technical recommendations.",

It is advisable to remove ice and snow from the inside of the wheels using hot water. ●If you drive on dirt or gravel tracks, the likelihood of stones becoming trapped inside wheel rims with plastic elements increases when driving at high speed or in a sporty manner. If you see that there are stones trap- ped between the aluminium wheel rim and the insert, you can attempt to remove them using pressurised water. For the sake of the environment Old tyres must be disposed of according to each country's laws. Note ●A CUPRA Service Centre should be consul- ted to find out whether wheels or tyres of different sizes to those originally fitted by CUPRA can be fitted, and to find out about the combinations allowed between the front axle (axle 1) and the rear axle (axle 2). ●Never mount used tyres if you are not sure of their “previous history”. Tyre life Fig. 201  Location of the tyre pressure sticker. Correct inflation pressures and sensible driving habits will increase the useful life of your tyres. ● Check tyre pressure at least once a month, and also prior to any long trip. ●The tyre pressure should only be checked when the tyres are cold. Do not reduce the pressure of warm tyres. ●Adjust tyre pressure to the load being carried by the vehicle ››› Fig. 201. ●In vehicles with a tyre pressure indicator, save the modified tyre pressure ››› page 342.",

Winter tyres ●Winter tyres must be fitted on all four wheels. ●Only use winter tyres that are approved for your vehicle. ●Please note that the maximum permissible speed for winter tyres may be lower than for summer tyres. ●Also note that winter tyres are no longer ef- fective when the tread is worn down. ●After fitting the wheels you must always check the tyre pressures. When doing so, take into account the correct tyre pressures listed on the rear of the front left door frame ››› page 334. In winter road conditions winter tyres will con- siderably improve vehicle handling. The design of summer tyres (width, rubber compound, tread pattern) gives less grip on ice and snow. This applies particularly to vehicles equipped with wide section tyres or with high speed tyres (code letters H, V or Y on the sidewall). Only use winter tyres of the correct type ap- proved for your vehicle. The sizes of these tyres are specified in the vehicle's documents (e.g. EC Certificate of Conformity or COC1)). The vehicle documentation varies depending on the country of residence. Winter tyres lose a great deal of their proper- ties when the tread is worn down to a depth of 4 mm. The performance of winter tyres is also se- verely impaired by ageing, even if the tread is still much deeper than 4 mm. A code letter indicating the speed limit is stam- ped on all winter tyres ››› page 332. In the infotainment system's Vehicle settings menu, a speed warning can be set in the Tyres menu. Vehicles capable of exceeding these speeds must have an appropriate sticker attached so that it is visible to the driver. Suitable stickers are available at specialised CUPRA Services, SEAT Official Service centres and specialised workshops. Please note the regulations to this effect in your country. “All-weather” tyres can also be used instead of winter tyres. Using winter tyres with a V-rating Please note that the generally applicable 240 km/h (149 mph) speed for winter tyres with the letter V is subject to technical restric- tions; the maximum permissible speed for your vehicle may be significantly lower. The maximum speed limit for these tyres depends directly on the maximum axle weights for your car and on the listed weight rating of the tyres being used. It is best to contact a specialised CUPRA Serv- ice or SEAT Official Service to check the max- imum speed which is permissible for the V- rated tyres fitted on your car on the basis of this information.",

Accessories, spare parts and repair work Introduction Always ask your dealer or specialist retailer for advice before purchasing accessories and re- placement parts. Your vehicle is designed to offer a high stand- ard of active and passive safety. For this rea- son, we recommend that you ask a specialised CUPRA Service or SEAT Official Service for ad- vice before fitting accessories or replacement parts. Your Official Service has the latest in- formation from the manufacturer and can rec- ommend accessories and replacement parts which are suitable for your requirements. They can also answer any questions you might have regarding official regulations. We recommend only using CUPRA accesso- ries and Genuine CUPRA parts®. Specialised CUPRA Services or SEAT Official Services have the necessary experience and facilities to en- sure that the parts are installed correctly and professionally. Although CUPRA continuously monitors the market, it cannot judge whether products not authorised by CUPRA meet the vehicle’s reli- ability, safety and suitability requirements. CU- PRA therefore accepts no liability for these products, even if, in certain cases, they are au- thorised by an officially recognised technical inspection institute or official body. Any retrofitted equipment which has a di- rect effect on the vehicle and/or the way it is driven, such as a cruise control system or electronically-controlled suspension, must be approved for use in your vehicle and bear the e mark (the European Union's authorisa- tion symbol). If any additional electrical devices are fitted which do not serve to control the vehicle itself (for instance a refrigerator box, laptop or venti- lator fan, etc.), they must bear the marking (manufacturer conformity declaration in the European Union).",

Information stored by the control units Preset lists and data services Valid in EU countries where the European Un- ion’s General Data Protection Regulation ap- plies: In-vehicle data processing Electronic control units are installed in the ve- hicle. The control units process data which they may receive from the vehicle's sensors, generate themselves or exchange with each other. Some of them are necessary for the safe operation of the vehicle, others assist with driving (driver assistance systems) and others allow comfort functions or additional infotain- ment system functions to be provided. Personal data references All vehicles are identified with a unique chas- sis number. This vehicle identification number can be used to identify the current and previ- ous owners of the vehicle, e.g. in Germany by contacting the Federal Motor Vehicle Office. There are also other ways to identify the owner or driver from data taken from the vehicle, e.g. the license plate. Therefore, the data generated or processed by the control units may be of a personal na- ture or, under certain conditions, become so. Depending on the available vehicle data, con- clusions can be drawn about aspects such as driving style, location, route or usage patterns in certain cases. Your data protection rights Under current data protection legislation, you have certain rights vis-à-vis CUPRA regarding the possible processing of your personal data. Accordingly, you are entitled to request that CUPRA or third parties, e.g. roadside assis- tance companies, workshops or providers of online services in the vehicle, inform you ex- tensively and free of charge, insofar as they have stored your personal data, about what data they hold on you and for what purpose, as well as the source of the data. You can also request information about data transfers to other parties. Further information about your legal rights, e.g. to delete or rectify data, can be found in the applicable legal data protection notices on the CUPRA website, including contact details and a note about the data protection officer. With specialist help, e.g. at a workshop (for a fee, if necessary), you can view all of the data stored locally in the vehicle.",

In addition, the manufacturer is liable for damages caused by a defective product. CUPRA also uses vehicle operating data for this purpose, e.g. for recall campaigns. These data can also be used to check customer claims where they wish to take advantage of a legal or commercial warranty.

Infotainment system Depending on the equipment you have selec- ted, you can provide data to the vehicle's info- tainment system yourself. Depending on the equipment in question, for example: ●Media data for playing music, films or photos on an infotainment system. ●Phonebook data for use in combination with a handsfree device or navigation system. ●Entered navigation destinations. ●Data on the use of online services. These data can be stored locally in the vehicle or on a device that you have connected to the vehicle, e.g. a mobile device, a USB drive or an MP3 player. As long as these data are stored in the vehicle, they can be deleted at any time. These data are only passed on to third parties at your request, depending on the settings you have selected (particularly in the context of us- ing online services). Integration of mobile devices If the vehicle has the appropriate equipment, you can connect your mobile device or other mobile terminal, if the corresponding function is available, to the vehicle so that you can con- trol them with the controls integrated in the vehicle. In this case, the image and sound from the mobile phone can be displayed and played through the infotainment system. At the same time, certain information is transmitted to your mobile device. For example, depending on the type of integration, position data and other general vehicle information. In this regard, seek more information about viewing apps in the infotainment system. This makes it possible to use certain apps in- stalled on the mobile device, e.g. navigation or music playback. No other interaction takes place between the mobile device and the vehi- cle. In particular there is no active access to vehicle data. The supplier of the application that is used determines the type of processing that the data subsequently undergo. Depend- ing on the app in question and the operating system of your mobile device, you may or may not be able to configure settings for this. Online services1) If the vehicle has a wireless network connec- tion, this makes it possible to exchange data between the vehicle and other systems. The wireless network connection is made through the vehicle's own transmitter and receiver unit, or through your own mobile terminal, e.g. a mobile device. Online functions such as online services and apps provided by CUPRA or other providers can be used over this connection. The manufacturer’s own services In the case of CUPRA online services, the cor- responding functions and their related data protection information are described or can be found in an appropriate place, e.g. in a sepa- rate service description or on an Internet page. Personal data may be used for the provision of online services. The data exchange takes place via a secure connection, e.g. using the manu- facturer’s IT systems provided for this purpose. In the absence of legal permission, contractual agreement or consent, personal data is only collected, processed and used for the provi- sion of services. You can activate and deactivate services and functions and, in some cases, also the vehicle's entire data connection.

Depending on vehicle equipment, this in- cludes data from systems such as: ●the adaptive cruise control ●the lane assist system ●the park assist systems ●the emergency brake functions. The EDR data are only recorded in specific ac- cident situations. No data are recorded in nor- mal driving conditions. No audio or video data inside or around the vehicle are recorded. Under no circumstances are personal data such as name, age, or gen- der recorded. Nevertheless, third parties (such as criminal proceedings authorities) may relate the contents of the EDR data to other data sources and create a personal reference in the context of an accident investigation. In order to read the EDR data it is necessary to access (if legally permitted to do so) the ve- hicle's ODB (“On-Board-Diagnose”) interface while the vehicle is switched on. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, third parties, such as judicial organisations with the appropriate tools, may be able to access the information if they have access to the vehicle or to the data recorded in the EDR. CUPRA will not have access to EDR data unless the owner (or, in “Leasing” cases, the lessee or hirer) gives their consent. There may be exceptions to this, depending on legal or con- tractual provisions. Due to legal requirements in safety-related products, CUPRA may use the EDR data for field research and in order to improve vehicle system quality. Any data used for research pur- poses will be treated anonymously (in other words, no reference will be made to the vehi- cle, its owner or the lessee/hirer).
